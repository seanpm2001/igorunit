title: generated function names must be <=31 characters
desc: |-
  Igor has a 31-char limit on object names. Should ensure that any generated objct names (such as test function names in particular) come in under this limit.
  
  Perhaps truncate names over 31 chars. Also could randomize some part of the generated name to ensure uniqueness. The observed name of the test function could be divorced from the generated name to maintain readability of test results.

  - changed status from unstarted to in_progress
  - Added a function name argument so groupname and testname are now independent from the actual name of the test function itself. For now, a 6-char random tag is added to the end of the concatenated groupname and testname to form the function name. The function name should mostly be invisible when writing tests using IgorUnit.
