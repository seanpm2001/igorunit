title: generated function names should handle spaces and other weird formatting
desc: |-
  The TEST macro should be able to take any string input and create a valid Igor function name. Use cases:
  
  1) Behavior-driven development type naming: TEST("Widgets", "should be springy") where "should be springy" is the *testname*. This has spaces in it that need to be scrubbed.
